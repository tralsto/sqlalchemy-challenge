# sqlalchemy-challenge: Module 10 Challenge

## Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. This repository contains an analysis of the Hawaiian climate from the provided data within the Resources Folder.

### Within the Jupyter Notebook file you find a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Part 2 of the Project was to design my very own Climate App which can be found in the .py file. This includes a landing page and multiple API routes containing analysis on the precipitation data, weather stations, variable temperatures, and temperature analysis for specified dates by the user.

### The files within this repository ultimately show I am able to analyze data utilizing the tools above. In addition, I was able to show the variable temperatures within Hawaii's climate for certain specified dates to help plan a trip for the best weather.
